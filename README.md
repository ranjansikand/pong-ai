# pong-ai
Adds a simple artificial intelligence to a two-player Pong game

This code is based on a pong game written by Colton Ogden for CS50 at Harvard. It adds a computer-controlled second player, as well as a two player mode.

Code is written in Lua, and can be executed by dragging the entire Pong folder onto a LOVE2D Desktop Shortcut
